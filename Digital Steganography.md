* Assignment 5 next monday

## Digital Steganography (Information Hiding)
* Steganography: developed with the internet (e.g digital watermarking), no knowledge of the existance of data
* Cryptography: although encryped and unreadable the existance of data is not hidden
* Steganography and cryptography are closely related and can be used together to produce better protection

### Cryptography
* Scrambel/encrypt text such that it is hopefuly unreadable by anyone except the intended reciever that can decrypt it 
  * **Plaintext:** original message
  * **Ciphertext:** the coded message
  * **Key:** info used tin cipher known only to sender/reciever
  * **Cipher:** algorithm for transforming pain text into ciphertext
  * **Encipher (Encrypt:** converting plaintext to ciphertext
  * **Decipher (Decrypt):** recovering ciphertext from paintext
* Encryption Schemes
* 





# Lev and Vi
**NOTE** this does not need to happen soon, just at some point in the next couple levels but you would have to keep us updated so we kinda know when
Big idea:
* Lev realizing the extent of his anger and I guess willingness to harm another creature which starkly contrasts to his original moral values.
* Vi
