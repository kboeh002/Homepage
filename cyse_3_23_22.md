### 3/23/22

* Not safe to use simple passwords, dictonary words, or anything easy to guess

There are two types of password cracking:

* **Brute Force Attack**: try every possible combination until finding the correct one 
  * e.g. 4 digit pin number (there are 10 numbers) ==> 10^4 = 1000 combinations
  * 4 digit chars (there are 50 characters available) ==> 40^4 = 6,250,000
  * 10 digit pin ==> 10^10 = 10,000,000,000
  * 10 digit chars ==> 50^10
 
* **Dictionary Attack**: use a list of potential passwords 
  * You want a unique pattern, not common words
* **Phishing**: create a duplicate/similar looking website so you will put your password in and then they have your information
* Social Engineering
* Malware

Once one password is comprimised, it will then be added to the file and is notlonger considered safe. Then all accounts with that password are comprimised.

Password Cracking Tools
* **Cain and Able**: popular password recovery tool for Microsoft windows
* **John the Ripper**: a fast password/most powerful cracker available for many systems
* **AirCrack-NG**: complete suite of tools to crack wifi passwords

## Password Storage

How are passwords stored in a database?
* Traditional Web Authentication Process: data storage and verification involved
1. Open Website
2. Put in your username and password
3. Transmitted to server and validates if it is the correct information
4. Opens and gives you cookies

Not likely to store plain text password, normally save as hashes

If you put in the same hash input, it will give the same hash output, therefore we make it so no two hashes are the same to avoid collisions

* Hash algorithm

1. Original Passowrd
2. Scrambles into hash to create a hash password
3. Hash of the password is stored

* Hashing: one of the most important ways to secure your password

## How to get Password Hashes
* **Linux**:
  * `/etc/shadow`
    * Contains password data
    * Viewable only by root user
    * Each line describes on user's account's password information
    * Each line is separated into fields with a `:` a as a field seperator
  * `/etc/password`
    * There is no password in this file

* **Windows**
  * 

### Hashing Algorithms
* Basic Properties
  * Generates fixed length output from given arbitraty data
  * For given input, always produces same output
  * Produces well separated hash pace
  * Helps to reduce time complexity of input elements

* Basic component of many cryptographic algorithms

* Collision: when given two different input produces the same output by the hashing function
  * Biggest problem with hash
  * Not unique hash
  * Collsions are inevitable if a hash function because most hash functions are not injective

Certain properties should be satisfied in hashing functions:
1. Given a message _m_ the message digest _h(m)_ can be calculated very quickly
2. Given a _y_ it is computationally infeasable to find *m'* with *h(m')=y*. it is a one way function
3. It is computationally infeasable to find messagls *m1* and *m2* with *h(m1) = h(m2)*
