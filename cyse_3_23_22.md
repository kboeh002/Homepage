# Password Cracking
### 3/23/22

* Not safe to use simple passwords, dictonary words, or anything easy to guess

There are two types of password cracking:

* **Brute Force Attack**: try every possible combination until finding the correct one 
  * e.g. 4 digit pin number (there are 10 numbers) ==> 10^4 = 1000 combinations
  * 4 digit chars (there are 50 characters available) ==> 40^4 = 6,250,000
  * 10 digit pin ==> 10^10 = 10,000,000,000
  * 10 digit chars ==> 50^10
 
* **Dictionary Attack**: use a list of potential passwords 
  * You want a unique pattern, not common words
* Phishing
* Social Engineering
* Malware

Once one password is comprimised, it will then be added to the file and is notlonger considered safe. Then all accounts with that password are comprimised.
