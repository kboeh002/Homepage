# Module 6 - Information Hiding
### 4/13/2022


##Assignment 7- Wi-fi Password Cracking due April 17th
* _You do not submit a lab report_
* You are going to send it secretly
* Write your answers in a text file and hide the answer sheet (text file) info in the cover image `monarch.bmp` using _steghide_ and encrypt the new image with your _UIN as the name_ of the new image and use your _midas id as the passphrase_ and submit that to blackboard. 
* **NOTE:** You cannot decode a file with Steghide if it was created with S-Tool


## Assignment 6- Information Hiding due April 24th


## Open Windows 7 VM
Digital Steganography Vocab Recap:
* Digital Steganography
* Plain Text- message you want to hide
* Cipher text- encoded
* Cover file- original file we want to hide the message in
* Output- the combined message and cover file

:. It requires message input, key for the cipher, and cover image


 `C://Lab Resources/Lab Resources/Module 6`
 * `adventureland` - Plain Text
 * `idea` - Audio File/Cover File
 * `Monarch` - Image File/Cover File
 * `octopus` - Image File


We are taking the least significant bit of each piece of data to replace in the new image


* S-tool is gui based and only supported in windows
* Steghide is command line based and therefore widely supported


Copy Module 6 folder to VMshare so you can access it in Windows 7

### S-Tool
#### Hiding Text in an Image
1. Drag the cover file into S-tool
2. Drag the file you want to hide in the image
3. Asks for a "Passphrase", "Verify passphrase", and the "Encryption algorithm" [IDEA, DES, Triple DES, MDS]
* must choose same password and encryption method for this type
4. Click enter and it gives you the image wit the encrypted data
5. Save file and make sure it is a bmp file
6. Compare the files
* the hidden file is the same size as the original
* Since we are only flipping 0's and 1's on the least significant bits in the cover file to create the hidden image we are not *adding* any information and therefore not adding anymore data. We are editing the data, but not adding to it therefore keeping it the same size.
7. Drag the hidden image back into S-tool
8. Type in the passphrase we set earlier and the encryption algorithm
* **NOTE:** in the bottom right hand corner you can see the max file size that can be hidden
9. Save the found file from the popout window. This will store the extracted hidden file.

#### Hiding Audio in an Image
* follow the same process as the Text in an image
* If you hide adventureland in the cover image and then use that as the cover image for the audio, it will break it. The files will nolonger be able to be recovered due to the crossing data.

### Steghide
#### Encryption
1. `steghide.exe embed -ef adventurelad.txt -sf octopus_w_adv.bmp -cf octopus.bmp`
* embed is a command to indicate the requested process
  * **Note:** any files needed must be located in the steghide folder
* `-ef` is a flag indicating the following file is the file 
* `-sf` is the output file
* `-cf` is the cover file
2. It will then prompt for a passohrase and confirmation of the passphrase
3. Then the new file will be created

#### Extraction
4. `steghide.exe extract -sf octopus_w_adv.bmp -xf extracted_adv.txt`
5. It will then request for you to enter passphrase, enter it
6. It will then write the extracted data to `extracted_adv.txt`
7. `steghide.exe embed -ef "C:\Users\Window 7\Desktop\credit_card.txt" -sf "C:\Users\Window 7\Desktop\credit_card_output.bmp" -p yourPassphrase`
* yourPassphrase is the passphrase used when you hid the file
* You can use a directory location to save/use files from other directories
