**Task B had something wrong, but the last announcement (4/16) tells you where the find the files for Module 5 assignment**

* You don't need to crack all the files, just the one that is assigned to you. to figure it out use an online hash generator and your midas ID. the last digit of the MD5 hash tells you which file to use

`cp usershare/worlistsrockyou/txt gz`

`ls`

`gunzip rockyou.txt gz`

`aircrack -ng WPA-PA-01.cap -w rockyou.txt`

* you just need a cap file and dictionary file to decrypt it

`wireshark WPA2-P5-01-dec.cap`

`airdecap -ng -p messenger`

* need -p to decrypt password
* Note: password is case sensitive

`airdecap -ng WAP2-p5-01.cap -p messenger -e CyberPHY`

`wireshark WPA2-P5-01-dec.cap`

* must use correct ESSID

For TCP flow it carries information from point A to point B because it is it is a transport layer protocol
