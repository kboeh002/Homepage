### 4/18/2022

**Task B had something wrong, but the last announcement (4/16) tells you where the find the files for Module 5 assignment**

* You don't need to crack all the files, just the one that is assigned to you. to figure it out use an online hash generator and your midas ID. the last digit of the MD5 hash tells you which file to use

`cp usershare/worlistsrockyou/txt gz`

`ls`

`gunzip rockyou.txt gz`

`aircrack -ng WPA-PA-01.cap -w rockyou.txt`

* you just need a cap file and dictionary file to decrypt it

`wireshark WPA2-P5-01-dec.cap`

`airdecap -ng -p messenger`

* Need -p to decrypt password
* **Note:** password is case sensitive

`airdecap -ng WAP2-p5-01.cap -p messenger -e CyberPHY`

`wireshark WPA2-P5-01-dec.cap`

* must use correct ESSID

For TCP flow it carries information from point A to point B because it is it is a transport layer protocol

There is no "correct" answer for B2 - it's basically just a recap of your knowledge.

# Extra Material - Web Application Security

**Web Application Security:** branch of information security that dels specifically with security of websites, web appliations, and web services
Most Common Issues in 2021
* Injection
* Broken Access control
* cryptographic failures
* injection
* insecure Design
* security misconfiguration
* vulnerable and outdated components
* identification and uthentication failures
* software and data integrity failures
* security logging and monitoring failures
* server side request forgery (SSRF)

#### Top 3:
* SLQ Injection: browser sends malicious input to server, bad input checking leads to malicious SLQ wury
* CSRF Cross Site Request Forgery: bad website sends browser request to good website, using credentials of an innocent victem
* XSS Cros site scripting: bad website sends innocent victem a script that steals information from an honest website

## PHP Example

`$recipient = $\_POST['recipient'];`

`$sql = "SELECT PersonID FROM Person WHERE Username = 'recipient'";`

`$rs=$db -> executeQuery($sql);`

 Problem- if recipient is a malicious string that changes the meaning of the query

### SLQ Injection

`set ok execute("Select * FROM Users WHERE user - 'usr1' AND pwd = '1234');`

`if not ok.EOF`

  `   log in success`

`else`

  `   fail;`

Your information on the website will be used as a single command

 #### OR command

Suppose the user enters "`not user1 'or 1=1 --`"

* you have injected an OR statement
* this is because of what we previously mentioned - the website takes in the input as a *single command*
 
`ok = execute (SELECT ...`

(T)1 AND 1(T) = T

(F)0 AND 1(T) = F


(T)1 OR 1(T) = T

(F)0 OR 1(T) = T

* so, as long as one item is right, then the output will always be true because you have injected an OR statement instead of AND

`WHERE usr = 'not me 'or 1-1 -- ... )`

* the "--" causes the rest of the line to be ignored, not the login always succeeds
* this makes it easy to log into many sites this way

Normal Query: `user = "Alice" AND PWD = "1234"`

Bad Query: `user = "Alice" "or 1=1 --"`

* The injection of these two statements is _always true_

#### DROP Command

Suppose `user =`  `"    '` `;DROP TABLE Users --"` 

* It will destroy the entire table on this server and similarly the attacker can add users and reset passwords

Suppose `user =` `   ` `';exec cmdshell 'net user badguy badpwd' /ADD--`

`ok = execute (SELEC ...` 

`  `WHERE username = ' ';exec ...)`
