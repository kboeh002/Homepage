## We are working in Internal Kali today

## WAP & WAP2
* WAP2 is the modern standard
* WEP is 802.11i
  * access control model based on 802.1X
  * flexable authentication framework based on EAP
  * authentication can be based on strong protocols (TLS)
  * authentication process results in a shared session key


  * defines the concept of RSN (Robust Security network)
  * defines an optional protocol ...

WPA uses TPIP, WEP, WPA2 is more secure

802.1X Model
1.  Supplicant requests access to the services (wants to connect ot the netwrok)
2.  authenticator controls access to the sercices (constrols the state of a port)
3.  the authentication server authorizes access ot the services 

* supplicant: mobile device (STA)
* authenticator: access point (AP)
* authentication server: server application running on the AP or on a dedicated machine
* port: logical state implemented in software in the AP

### Protocols
* EAP (Extensivble Authentication Protocol) [RFC 7324]

`
iwconfic
ls
cd CYSE 301/
wireshark lab4wpa2
`

Search `eapol` in wireshark
* shows the messages
* there are 4 messages- these are called 4-Way hashes
* Who started the first hashes? the network Cisco because the timestamp is the smallest

### 4 Way Handshake
* Objective- prove that AP also knows the PMK (result of authentication)
* exchange random values to be used in the generation of PTK

-------        ------
| STA | <----- | AP |
-------        ------



Steps in this exchange...
1. Router (AP) and generates ANonce
2. STA generates STA sends its own nonce value  (SNonce) to the AP together with a message integrity code (MIC) including authentication which is message authetication and integrity code (MAIC)
3. AP constructs and sends GTK
4. constructs the PTK with the ANonce

WPA and WPA2 follow the same 4 way handshake
