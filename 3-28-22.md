## Quiz Review
* Hash functions: MD5, SHA512, SHA256 are all included
  * Not included AES
* Salt is a random number to add to the user's original password which will prevent the use of a rainbow table
* Hash alforithm can be used to check data integrity, to fingerprint a large file, to be used for a difital signeture, it is irreversable
* It is possible to find two different messages with the same hash output
  * It is computationally _infeasable_ to find two different messages with the same hash ouput, not imopossable
* A hash function, AKA kmessage difest,m is a one way function
* For a given hash alforithm, the length of the output is _always_ the same length
* Given a message is computationally infeasable to find a message which has the same hash value of another
* Salt effectively prevents the use of a rainbow table, can slow down the dictionary attack, and provides an additional layer of protection to the password
* Cracking hash is *not* the only way for the hacker to know the user's password 
  * (Ex. social engineering)
* We can hash files of *any* size


* Linux file security is the most basic access/authentication and rights/authorization  
* Each user has a unique ID (UID),
* Each user is part of at least one froup and haas a unique group ID (GID)
  * a user can be in up to 16 groups, but can only belong to one primary group at any given time
  * **Primary Group**: (of a user) is applied as the "owning" group on any files or directories the user creates
* User types:

1. **Super User:** "root" , has full access
2. **Regular User:** have acess to their own home directory only, their UID's will always be greater than 1000
3. **Pseudo Users:** Accounts that arrived built into the system and do not reflect *real* users\

#### /etc/passwd File
* `/etc/passwd` is a ; delimeted file which lists 
* Breakdown
  * nir:x:500:500:NIR:/home/nir/bin/bash
    * UserName:x:UID:GID:Username:HomeDirectory

#### /etc/shadow File
* file holds the account passwords and their related settings
* the entry is broken down left to right

1. username
2. encrypted password
* each file and.or directory in linux is owned by a sinlge user and belongs to a single group
* the ownership details are assigned at the time the file or directory are created
* user and group ownership are distinct it is possible to not be a member but still own the group
  * -rwxrwxr-- 1 user1 group1 35 Jul 19 13:42 file2
  * can find this with `ls -l /etc/shadow`
    * first `-` means it is a regular file, the rest of them are permissions
    * The next 3 "rwx" is the owner permission 
    * Then after the owner the next 3 "rwx" is the group permissions
    * And the last 3 `r--` are the anyone else (not owner or in group) permissions
    * Owner "user1"
    * "group1" group owner
    * Then there is the date created
  * `id` command tells you what group the user belongs to
  * `whoami` command tells you your current user
  * `sudo id` will then make it so you have temporary root permissions
    * You could use this to then add permissions to the file
* shadow file and password file have the same list of *users*, but have different information
  * *userName*:$_hasMethod_$*encryptedPasswordAkaHash*:*lastPasswordChange*:
  * Algorithm for hash key:
    * $1$ :md5
    * $2a$ :Blowfish
    * $2y$ :Blowfish, with correct handling of 8-bit characters
    * $5$ :sha256
    * $6$ :sha512

* `sudo head /etc/shadow` will let us see the stuff in the shadow file
* `sudo password` will let us add a password to the root user (in this case there was no password originally on the root user)
  * then `su root` will prompt you for the password you created and you can switch to root (check with `whoami`
* password file does not contain any password information, but the shadow file does 
* `/etc/group` is for the group 
* While logged into root you can change the password for any user with the `user _password_`
  * replace password with `passwd userName`

### Password Bracking (Linux)
1. `cat/etc/passwd` to view the account information
