# Internet History and Architecture
### 1/11/23
## Internet != Web
* The internet is the connection for communication purposes between the computers all over the earth
* Internet includes (but is not limited to):
    * Web
    * File Transfer
    * VolP
    * IM
    * Streaming video
    * Email
* Internet is a network, the web is just part of it
    * Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web
    * Vint Cerf invented the internet
        * (**ARPA Net** -- **A**dvanced **R**esearch **P**roject **A**gency)
    * Was originally a government project that the government funded and trusted academia to handle inventing it; they wanted a *general purpose network* with *general purpose accessing*
        * previously it was all extremely specific with exact path and direct location to send to
### What is the internet?
* Millions of connected computing devices
    * hosts = end systems
    * running network apps
* Communication Links
    * Different media (fiber, copper, wire, radio, satellite)
        * **Radio:** (in this application) high frequency entities that aren't disrupted by weather disturbances
        * satellites are geocentric
    * Different transmission rates of bps (bits per second; 10<sup>3</sup>=Kbps, 10<sup>6</sup>=Mbps, 10<sup>9</sup>=Gbps)
* **Routers:** forward packets of data through the network
* **Protocols:** contorl sending and recieving messages
    * eg. TCP, IP, HTTP, SMTP
* **Internet**:  "network of autonomous systems"; loosely hierarchical
    * Public int*er*net cs private int*tra*net
* Internet Standards
    * **RFC:** Request For Comments
    * **IETF:** Internet Engineering Task Force


# Hints
* only use binary stuff...
