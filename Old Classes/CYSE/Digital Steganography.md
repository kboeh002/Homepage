* You can submit missed assignments to see if it will improve your grade
* Assignment 5 next monday

## Digital Steganography (Information Hiding)
* Steganography: developed with the internet (e.g digital watermarking), no knowledge of the existance of data
* Cryptography: although encryped and unreadable the existance of data is not hidden
* Steganography and cryptography are closely related and can be used together to produce better protection

### Cryptography
* Scrambel/encrypt text such that it is hopefuly unreadable by anyone except the intended reciever that can decrypt it 
  * **Plaintext:** original message
  * **Ciphertext:** the coded message
  * **Key:** info used tin cipher known only to sender/reciever
  * **Cipher:** algorithm for transforming pain text into ciphertext
  * **Encipher (Encrypt:** converting plaintext to ciphertext
  * **Decipher (Decrypt):** recovering ciphertext from paintext
* Encryption Schemes
* c=E(m,k)
  * Encryption alcorithm = E
  * Decryption algorithm = D
  * secret key = k
  * encrypt plaintext m alice sends c=E(m,k) to bob
  * to decrypt a cyphertext c bob computes m'=D(ck)
  * scheme is valid if m'=m
  * it is secure if you cannot learn m from c

## Caesar's Cipher
  *  One of the simplest ciphers
  *  Key: k = number between 0 and 25
  *  Encryption: encode the ith letter as the (i+k)^th letter
    *  So... z+1 ==> a
  *  Decryption: decode the jth letter to the (j-k)^th letter

## Stegography
  *  Goal of steganography is no knowledge of the existance of the message
  *  Used for 
    * Secret messaging
    * Copy right protection
      * Digital watermarking != digital steganography
      * used primarily for identification
      * embedding a unique piece of information withing a medium without noticable altering the medium
      * almost impossible to remove without seriously degrading an image
    * Malicious purposes 
  * information must _never_ be aparent to a viewer unaware of its presence

### Types of Steganography
* text
* image
* audio/video files
#### Algorithms
##### Hiding in Text Text
 * first letter algorithm
 * every nth letter
 * altering the amount of whitespace
 * using a publicly available cover source

#### Hiding in Images
* most popular medium
* least significant bit (LSB) modifications (24 vs 8 bit images)
  * most common
  * RGB colors have * bits for each of those colors (total 24 bits)
    * 8 bits can represent 256 numbers
    * RHS is least significant bit


#### Video Files
* much easier because there are numerous images to hide things in


* masking and filtering
* algorithms and transformations
* deep learning

Tools: Stools (Windows, GUI enabled), Steghide
* Steganalysis: hiding info within electronic media requires alteration of the media properties and introduces some form of degradation
* Detection Approaches
1. Detecting messages or their transmission
2. disabling embedded information
* For images LSB methods can be done with compression techniques

Write a 2 page credit on Steganalysis aproaches and detection for extra credit
Assignment will be introduced next class




# Lev and Vi
**NOTE** this does not need to happen soon, just at some point in the next couple levels but you would have to keep us updated so we kinda know when
Big idea:
* Lev realizing the extent of his anger and I guess willingness to harm another creature which starkly contrasts to his original moral values.
* Vi is reminded that she must control her magic, that it is still *so* easy to lose control of.

Lev has been downed and rolled some death saves that he failed already. Once he gets up he is going to harm the individual in such a way that is torturous or permanently crippling
* example- he actually breaks the legs/every bone in a persons body

In Response vi freaks out and ends up going up to him and *accidentally* uses inflict wounds killing him, like _actually_ killing him, not just downing him
  * The wild magic surge table also has affect 33-34 "Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute." which will help with the affect garenteeing he will go down
* this is due to her own trauma with the arms that it is cruel to do it
* it is better to just outright kill the person then and there than make them suffer then and/or with lifelong disability/affects
she then realized she has killed him and has a freakout over it (see document above the NPC information for the bit I have already written up)
Then has something similar to a Rapunzel scene from tangled discovering she has revivify
* this will bring up the dangers again
* it will also cause her to have issues with how she couldn't do this in the past when she needed it most, so **trauma**

It will also probably freak out the party a bit with both of their actions between Lev's vindictive nature he has discovered and the dangers of Vi's magic
